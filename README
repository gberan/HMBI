There are a few lines you must edit in order to get HMBI working. Do the following:

$ cd bin/
$ pwd
$ nano hmbi.run


----------------
### Change the following line to the current location of this bin folder (the output of pwd above):
EXE_PATH="/home/jessica/hmbi_stable/bin"

### Change this line to your path to your openmpi executables (execute `which mpirun` to get the path):
export MPIHOME=/home/software/qc_ext_libs/openmpi/

----------------

$ cd ../src/
$ nano makefile

----------------
### Uncomment the compiler of your choice
#CC = g++
#FC = gfortran
#CC = icpc
#FC = ifort

### Change this path to the location of your mpiCC executable (execute `which mpiCC` to get the path)
MPICC = /home/software/qc_ext_libs/openmpi/bin/mpiCC

### Update the library path to your compilers
LDFLAGS =  -L/opt/intel/compilers_and_libraries_2016.3.210/linux/compiler/lib/intel64 -limf -lifcore -liomp5 -lintlc -L/opt/intel/mkl/lib/intel64 -lmkl_core -lmkl_lapack95_lp64 -lmkl_blas95_lp64 -lmkl_intel_lp64 -lmkl_intel_thread
----------------

Finally install HMBI

For a serial compilation only:
$ make serial

For a parallel compilation only:
$ make serial

For all compilations:
$ make all

Move the executable to your bin directory:
$ make install

Now add your bin directory to either your .bashrc or .cshrc

.cshrc:
set path = ( $path /home/jessica/hmbi/bin)

.bashrc:
export PATH="/home/jessica/hmbi/bin:$PATH"
