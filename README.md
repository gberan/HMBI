# HMBI
Hybrid Many-body Interaction Code

This code performs fragment-based electronic structure calculations, particularly for molecular crystal, according to the hybrid many-body interaction (HMBI) model.  It was authored by the Beran research group in the Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Riverside.  Descriptions of the method and examples of its use can be found in the scientific literature.
